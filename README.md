# Do Minimum Wages Affect Unemployment?

## Overview  
This paper studies the causal impact of state‐level minimum wage changes on unemployment rates in the U.S. from 1976 to 2016. It uses panel methods—OLS, fixed effects, difference-in-differences, and interactions—on a rich state‐year dataset (2,091 observations) and a federal‐level robustness check.

## Key Highlights  
- **Research Question:** How do state minimum wage changes affect unemployment?  
- **Data:** State and federal macroeconomic indicators (minimum wages, unemployment, GDP, inflation, LFPR, poverty, CPI, interest rates) for all 50 states + DC, 1976–2016.  
- **Methodology:**  
  1. Descriptive analysis & diagnostics  
  2. Pooled OLS (naïve)  
  3. Multivariate OLS with controls  
  4. State & year fixed-effects panel  
  5. Difference-in-differences for “treated” states  
  6. Interaction models (state×federal wages)  
  7. Federal-level robustness check  
- **Main Finding:** In the preferred fixed-effects specification, minimum wage changes have no statistically significant effect on unemployment once heterogeneity and macro shocks are controlled.
